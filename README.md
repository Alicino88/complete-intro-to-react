I have written this repository while coding along the course https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v6/
The course walks you through building a small React app without using the create-react-app command but instead installing all the dependencies manually (e.g. Parcel and Babel).
(on this I have written a blog post https://www.aliceiscoding.com/setting-up-a-react-project-from-scratch)

The app is very simple, it allows to search for a specific animal and bread and then it displays the results.
By clicking on the single result (a Pet.js component), React Router together with useParams hook allows to go to the Detail page for each single animal.

I wanted to follow this course to revise the following concepts:
-useEffect hook
-useState hook
-useParams hook
-React router

To start the local dev server "npm run dev"
